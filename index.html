      <br>
      <img class="my-photo" src="Images/bio.jpg" alt="selfie of the creator of the page" width="400px" height="540px">
      <p>My name is Tsvetoslav "Sean" Shalev, and I am an IT enthusiast looking to build a career out of his passion for technology. I am comfortable with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap, using Atom or VS Code IDEs (Win10). Currently, I am also learning JavaScript, jQuery and React, as well as Backend Web Development fundamentals.</p>
      <p>Between 2013 and 2018 I worked as a Transport For London Contractor (platelayer) and a freelance IT Consultant before I joined one of UK's top 50 MSPs as a Service Desk Engineer in May of 2018. Some of the key technical skills that I've developed further include the building, upgrading and maintenance of computers and systems, scripting through Command-Line and PowerShell, working with RMM software (Win10 & macOS) and Azure Intune, knowledge on networking fundamentals, as well as a Hamilton Mercer-certified level of customer service. I also possess soft skills such as excellent teamwork, process-adherence and time-management using workloads' prioritisation to meet and improve on SLAs.</p>
      <p>As a firm believer in civilised discourse and collaborative effort, my goal is to secure a front-end web developer role with a team of good people, so I can continue to expand on my technical capabilities and support a career as an IT professional.</p>
